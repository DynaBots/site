Hello there! We are Team Dynabots: Alma, Aniket, Joe, Carolyn, and Rijuta. We’re a team of Human-Computer Interaction + Design grad students at the University of Washington. For our capstone project, we are conceptualizing the future of journalism and interactive content together with a team of mentors and our project sponsor, Intel.

As a diverse and talented team with significant experience in design research, physical prototyping, and software development, the chance to build something critically interesting and novel, backed by good reasoning and thorough research, is super compelling. So compelling, in fact, that we intend to submit a publication about our project to a conference, such as CHI 2015.

We are certainly a team of passionate individuals, so we aim to leave debates in meetings when those passions flare up. We also intend to do our best work and not stop at anything less—this may make for long nights, but we owe this to ourselves and each other. Our drive for excellence is what keeps us going.

Here’s a bit more about each of us—where we come from and what we’re interested in:

**Joe Kohlmann** earned a B.S in Computer Sciences from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, after which he spent a year working as a research intern in both a virtual reality lab and a data visualization lab. After working in multi-disciplinary teams on problems in HCI, visualization, interface design, user testing, and conference publishing, he turned west to attend the University of Washington to earn his masters degree. His goals are to apply his technical skills to rapid prototyping and design challenges and improve his use of research frameworks.
