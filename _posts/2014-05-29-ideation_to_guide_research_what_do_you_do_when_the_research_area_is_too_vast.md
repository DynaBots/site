What happens when the area you are approaching is too vast to even know which part you are want to research? How do you narrow down your research areas, so that the research you do is effective and meaningful? After all, none of us likes to read tons of academic articles for no purpose!

We were given a wide topic area: **3D Gestures and Digital Publication.** Ok, So now what? Where do we start? We started by general term queries, and soon realized there was too much diversity to be able to conduct the research with general term queries. So, we decided to do an ideation session within the research. In a way, we decided to do an affinity diagram of the potential research paths we could take, to be able to focus our research.

We started with the theme of “Experience of 3D Published Content”, and then began to define it.

{% image default "Photos & Videos/5-29 Experience of 3D Published Content/Experience of 3D Published Content Panorama.JPG" alt="Experience of 3D Published Content Whiteboard Chart" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-YvMLVHMKS6ekYyNUFvWjRrMHc/view?usp=sharing" %}

What do we mean by experience? We defined it as feeling that you are in the action. You are part of the content you are consuming.

**3D:** Why do we even need 3D? What value does 3D content add to our content?

**Published:** what kind of publishing pattern and mode are we interested in? Daily, weekly, or monthly? Explanatory or Investigatory?

**Content:** What type of content are we talking about? Are we referring to 3D text content? (Hope not, 'cause that would be dizzying!), How about images. videos, and objects?

Then we started writing out all the content types, varieties, topics, and manipulation techniques that we thought would be interesting or meaningful if delivered within a 3D medium. Furthermore, along with each Post-It that a team member put up, we explained why it would be a good idea to have that content in 3D. In a way, we started thinking about all the different ways 3D could be used. Even how people would be able to interact with their pets from a distance! 

Next, we decided to arrange our suggestions in clusters(themes), and tried to find connections between the the different clusters.   What resulted from this exercise was certain defined paths that we could now take in furthering our research. For example, some of our clusters were:

* Long lived (longer shelf life than newspapers, like magazines)
* Social Collaboration and Sharing
* Explorations in space and time
* 3D Visualization as an added layer of information for content communication

What came out of this exercise? Clarity on how to pursue our research from here. We decided on pursuing three main topic areas:

1. Can 3D visualization be an additional layer of meaningful data for object and/or space exploration?
2. What experience does the publisher want to deliver?
3. What experiences do people expect from publishers? Does it match the experience that the publishers want to deliver?
